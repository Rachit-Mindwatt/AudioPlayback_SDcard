# AudioPlayback_SDcard
This project demonstrates how to use the ESP32 to play an MP3 file stored on an SD card and output the audio through I2S to an external amplifier or audio device, such as the MAX98357A. The code leverages the Audio Library for audio file playback, providing a simple yet effective way to turn the ESP32 into a dedicated MP3 audio player.
